          Open-endedness is an active field of research in the pursuit
of capable Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), allowing models to pur-
sue tasks of their own choosing. Simultaneously, recent advancements
in Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o [9] have allowed
such models to be capable of interpreting image inputs. Implementa-
tions such as OMNI-EPIC [4] have made use of such features, providing
an LLM with pixel data of an agent’s POV to parse the environment
and allow it to solve tasks. This paper proposes that providing these
visual inputs to a model gives it greater ability to interpret spatial en-
vironments, and as such, can increase the number of tasks it can suc-
cessfully perform, extending its open-ended potential. To this aim, this
paper proposes VoyagerVision - a multi-modal model capable of creating
structures within Minecraft using screenshots as a form of visual feed-
back, building on the foundation of Voyager. VoyagerVision was capable
of creating an average of 2.75 unique structures within fifty iterations
of the system, as Voyager was incapable of this, it is an extension in
an entirely new direction. Additionally, in a set of building unit tests
VoyagerVision was successful in half of all attempts in flat worlds, with
most failures arising in more complex structures. Code is available at

        The system operates within the environment of Minecraft, a 3-dimensional world
  where the terrain and all structures are made out of ’blocks’, these blocks may
  be broken provided the player possesses the correct tools. On collection, these
  blocks may also be placed again, allowing the creation of structures and build-
  ings. Within Minecraft, one of the two primary objectives of a player/agent is
  to acquire resources to create better tools, which in turn, allows the collection
  of more resources and even better tools. This process is the focus of the orig-
  inal Voyager paper[13]. Another main focus is the creative process of creating
  structures with the blocks the player gains while exploring - this often includes
  practical structures such as a house or a nether portal (which allows further
  exploration in a different world), and purely creative pursuits such as decorative
  sculptures. As shown in Fig. 3, the agent has been provided with multimodal
  inputs, enabling the pursuit of these building-focused tasks which are key to
  the gameplay loop of Minecraft. The new prompts which have been used for
  VoyagerVision, as well as the originals can be found in Appendices C to E.
  The first curriculum task in the curriculum requires the agent to acquire 1
  wooden log, which facilitates further building and resource gathering while being
  a straightforward first step. On any other iteration, the curriculum agent uses its
  system prompt, a screenshot of the agent’s current POV, a textual description
  of the environment, and the history of previous successes and failures to decide
  what task should be pursued next. The action agent uses this proposed task, the
  system prompt, and the same environment inputs to generate code for the agent
  to perform to solve the task, using the Mineflayer API [10]. At this point, the
  action agent may refer to functions already stored in the skill library which are
  helpful. The function generated by the action agent is then executed in the game
  environment. Following this, the critic agent verifies the success of the task. For
  resource gathering tasks, the textual environment information, such as nearby
  blocks and what is currently in the agent’s inventory, is likely to be sufficient.
  However, for building-based tasks, the agent’s POV is needed to verify if the
  task has been truly completed. If the task was successful, it is reported as such,
  the code is stored in the skill library, and the curriculum agent generates a new
  task. Otherwise, the agent provides a critique to the action agent, which uses
  this feedback to try generating the code again. If the agent fails the maximum
  number of times (set to 3 in the default Voyager implementation), the task is
  marked as failed, and this is added to the list of failed tasks. This information is
  then used to assist the curriculum agent in generating a new task which is more
  approachable for the agent.

            Below is an example image of each of the structures the agent was tasked with building as part of the unit tests. From left to right the structures get progressively more difficult to build. The agent being able to complete each of these tasks would demonstrate a strong ability to compose structures in a focused and isolated setting, a strong foundation for open-ended learning.

              <em>Task:</em> Create a wooden wall 4 blocks high and 4 blocks long in a flat open space.<br>
              <em>Context:</em> N/A
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Stairs Task Prompt</strong><br>
              <em>Task:</em> Create a wooden staircase 3 blocks high.<br>
              <em>Context:</em> The staircase should be composed of 3 adjacent pillars, one 3 blocks high, one 2 blocks high and one 1 block high, use wooden planks.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Pyramid Task Prompt</strong><br>
              <em>Task:</em> Create a three tier spruce plank pyramid.<br>
              <em>Context:</em> Begin with a 6x6 platform on the ground. On top of this platform, centred on its middle 4x4 blocks, add a 4x4 platform. Finally, on top of this 4x4 platform in its middle 2x2 blocks, add a 2x2 platform.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Portal Task Prompt</strong><br>
              <em>Task:</em> Create a nether portal.<br>
              <em>Context:</em> The portal should be made of obsidian, the sides should be 5 blocks tall with the base 4 blocks wide. Once you have completed the structure, light the inside with your flint and steel to form a nether portal. Ensure no dirt scaffolding remains inside the portal or else it will not light correctly.
